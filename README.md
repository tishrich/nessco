This project was done to further experiment with HTML5, CSS 3, and JavaScript/jQuery making an AI to HTML project.

I first designed the layout using Adobe Illustrator. Once I make a mock up I then took it to HTML and coded it. I experimented with hovers and scrolls.

All of the pictures are my own.
